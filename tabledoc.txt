--- devices

devices have the concept of "loops" which are different alarm circuits. for example a door sensor often has two loops. one for the magnetic sensor, and one for external wires that can be connected.  The water sensor has three loops - one for water, one for low temerature, oone for high tempaerature.

number - device ID from the device itself.  this is usually on a sticker on the outside and inside of the device.
name - friendly nae for the device, like "front door"
closed_bit - number corresponding to which bit changes on open/close. Mosty 128 or 32 for door/window sensors.

type  - text e.g., window, door, describing class of device
loop1 - text displayed for loop1 open
loop2 - text displayed for loop2 open
loop3 - text displayed for loop3 open
normal - text for normal state, e.g. "closed"
priority - not yet used

example:

 number |      name       | closed_bit |  type  | loop1 | loop2 | loop3 | normal | priority 
--------+-----------------+------------+--------+-------+-------+-------+--------+----------
 500909 | basement_window |        128 | window | open  |       |       | closed |        0
            



--- events

logs all events from the wireless devices

time - timestamp for event
source - name of device reporting the event
event - the event, open, close, heartbeat
flag - flag for reportable vs heartbeat
code - integer code reported by device


example

            time            |     source     | event  | flag | code
